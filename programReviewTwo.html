    <p>In this second part of my review, I reflect on the most critical assignments I have found within my Bachelor of Science in Information Science program. As I am preparing for a career in information-related organizations, I must be able to effectively highlight the quality of my experience and skills. With that in mind, projects are an incredible way of showcasing teamwork and technical expertise, while illustrating my thinking process and the concepts I know.</p>
    
    <p>Throughout the Bachelor of Science in Information Science program. I covered courses dealing with user experience, problem-solving, data analysis, information ethics, and programming. Among the many projects and assignments that I have completed, there are a few that stand out the most when searching for a career. My programming projects, Cash Register and Storm Tracker, written in C++, highlighted my ability to program in C++ and utilize Visual Studio as a tool. The Cash Register project shows how I can develop a functional cash register, one that could be refined and improved and then deployed into the real world, like the ones that can be found at every store. The Storm Tracker project shows how I can search databases and create a search tool that refines searches based on whether they meet certain criteria. If further refined and improved, it could be used as a database search tool, like online libraries, or databases that have vast quantities of information.</p>

    <p>The Calculator project and the Card Trick project are programming projects written in the programming language Java. Highlights how I can use Java, and I can develop and design a calculator with a graphic user interface. While it is not refined and as advanced as the calculator you may have on a phone or computer. It shows the essence of how, if improvements were made, it could very well be. The DataMart and Airline Tweets projects were team-based assignments in which I served as the group leader for a team of four. Our responsibilities included cleaning, preprocessing, developing training, and creating analytical visualizations to strengthen the findings. These experiences also highlighted my leadership, technical, communication, and programming skills in R. The final assignment is to create a portfolio. This project required me to compile and present the best examples of my academic work, along with reflections, and the opportunity to organize and document my work. Serving as the backbone of what I can share with my employers as I transition into a career.</p>

    <p>Overall, my projects are going to be the most impactful assignments through my academic journey in the BSIS program. These projects allowed me to apply the concepts I learned in my courses to real-world, applicable scenarios. From leading team projects like DataMart and Airline Tweets to projects by myself, Cash Register, Storm Tracker, Card Trick, and Calculator. I have enough technical and soft skills to continue learning in a professional career.</p>
