    <p>In this review, I will reflect upon how these courses have equipped me with the technical and analytical skills essential for my future career goals and aspirations. Reviewing the relevance of these courses will illustrate the importance of BSIS and how it has shaped and prepared me for the challenges ahead.</p>

    <p>The courses in Information Science Concentrated in Data Science & Analytics are essential to equip me with the knowledge to understand information science within data science and analytics in todayâ€™s world. LIS 3261 Intro to Information Science introduced me to the fundamental principles of how information is created, stored, organized, and utilized. LIS 4800 Introduction to Data Science introduced me to basic data science concepts, such as collection, cleaning, analysis, and interpretation. LIS 4761 Intro to Data/Text Mining introduced me to the basics of finding patterns within data. LIS 3352 Interaction Design focused on the importance of intuitive design, user interfaces, and user experience. LIS 3353 IT Concepts/Info Professionals covered the principles of information and managing their ethical challenges. LIS 4204 Information Behaviors covered insights into where to search for, and how to evaluate information. LIS 4273 Advanced Statistics & Analytics provided me with more advanced statistical methods and techniques within R. LIS 4317 Visual Analytics taught me how to create data visualizations to effectively communicate my analysis. LIS 4805 Predictive Analytics focused on how to create models and methods to predict future trends.</p>

    <p>LIS 4414 Information Policy and Ethics, CIS 3360 Principles of Information Security, and CIS 4365 Computer Security Policies provided me with a foundation for understanding the regulatory, ethical, and security aspects of information. These skills allow me to assess risk and evaluate and implement policies to safeguard information. LIS 4930 Crime Analysis: Mapping, CCJ 3024 Survey of the Criminal Justice System, CJE 3650 Introduction to Forensic Science, and CJE 4114 American Law Enforcement Systems broadened my perspective on how data and analytics can be applied to the world of criminal justice. This experience allows me to interpret crime-related data, along with the methods and legal context behind it. ENC 3250 Professional Writing enabled me to write complex and clear essays professionally. EDF 3604 Schools and Society, HSC 4430 Occupational Health & Safety, and SLS 3308 Job Search provided me with practical career development skills essential for navigating the job market. While LIS 4370 R Programming, COP 2030 Programming Concepts, COP 2250 Object-Oriented Programming (Java SE), and COP 2250 Object-Oriented Programming (Java SE) highlight the different technical programming languages with which I have experience within my academic journey.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, all these courses culminate in LIS 4934 BSIS Senior Capstone, where I can review and apply the diverse skills and knowledge, I acquired throughout the BSIS program. This capstone experience provides an opportunity to display my growth and translate my insights into real-world applications, spanning areas from Data Science & Analytics to Policy, Ethics, and Security; from Criminal Justice and Forensic Science to Writing & Communication; and from General Education & Career Development. I am now equipped and ready to tackle future challenges and seize new opportunities in my career.</p>
