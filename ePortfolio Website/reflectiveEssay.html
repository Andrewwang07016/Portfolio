    <p> Looking back upon my studies and coursework in Information Science, I have developed a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts within this field. Throughout my academic journey, I encountered challenges that tested my resolve and significantly honed my critical thinking and analytical skills. The diverse range of topics from data analysis and programming to design, information systems, ethics, and security has equipped me with the versatile knowledge necessary to continue to pursue my career goals. </p>

    <p>What seemed the most interesting during my Information Science journey was my interest in programming and data analysis. This program has prepared me well for a career in this area since the courses spanned various aspects of software development and artificial intelligence. Although the specific programming languages introduced in class may not be the intended programming languages, I intend to master. They have expanded my skill set by introducing me to new language structures and syntax. This is important since adaptability in the tech industry is an important trait that employers are seeking during these uncertain times.</p>

    <p>One of the most emphasized parts of the Information Science program was the importance of information. Information has been what drives artificial intelligence, and being able to manage and manipulate this now shows the progress that I have made. The availability of online courses was also beneficial. Since it allowed me to manage my expenses by living off-campus and avoiding additional costs such as meal plans or dorm fees. This has provided me with the freedom to manage and make my own choices when it comes to navigating the curriculum. One improvement that could be made would be the expansion of greater programming language variety. Although I do not plan to pursue a more advanced degree immediately. I am committed to continuing learning on my own. Since new programming languages and methodologies for data analysis and software development can be self-taught.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, my experience in the Information Science program has reshaped my outlook when looking toward my future career goals. This is because it has provided me with a practical foundation in technology, expanding and improving my critical thinking skills, and preparing me for more challenging challenges in programming and data analysis. I am thankful for this opportunity to gain experience and grow. I look forward to furthering my knowledge.</p>
