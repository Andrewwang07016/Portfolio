	<p> Quantum computing refers to using quantum mechanics to further develop the capabilities of traditional computing. Companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and IBM are at the forefront of quantum computing. They strive to surpass the capabilities of traditional computers and develop something revolutionary. D-Wave, a commercial supplier of quantum computers, claims to have solved this complex physics problem relating to magnetism. </p>

	<p> As this technology continues to be researched and further developed, it could have significant implications for information policy. The magnetic problem relates to how electrons arrange themselves under quantum mechanics. This challenge that has stumped theoretical physicists for years, is now seeing breakthroughs. However, these claims are challenged “New York, and other companies showed that by improving classical techniques, they could still run the same calculations on ordinary computers” (Castelvecchi, 2025, para. 8). While this demonstrates that quantum computing has not performed to the point where it has made traditional computing obsolete there is cause for concern within information policy. In this sense it’s a race for who can develop and create technology that all countries want their hands on. Communications, banking systems, and government infrastructure, to name a few, are what runs the world. </p>


	<p> Policymakers may soon need to establish new regulations and policies to address quantum computing. Since quantum computing can theoretically revolutionize the technology industry, there have been many examples where companies have exaggerated their claims, which leads to a false representation of where quantum computing currently is. Another policy pertains to cybersecurity, more specifically encryption. This is because quantum computers have the potential to break traditional methods, meaning that sensitive information and data could be compromised as quantum computing continues to be developed. It’s going to be important to keep an eye and track the progress of quantum computing since there is a lot at stake. “Virtually all agencies are concerned with cybersecurity in the context of QC” (Liman, 2023, Section II). Globally, economically, quantum computing could have a big impact as an emerging technology. It continues to be uncertain, therefore there should be a framework or policy developed to mitigate many of these risks. It stretches further out than just the United States. “Now is the time for Europe to be digitally sovereign” (Liman, 2023, Section III). It is a concern for even Europe and likely other countless countries since quantum computing could theoretically make traditional computing obsolete when the whole world revolves around it. Consider raising concerns about these advancements being exploited and used for cyber warfare. </p>


	<p> In conclusion, quantum computing is likely not to advance to the point where all potential can be harnessed all at once. Instead, it’s a gradual and more research and development must be done. Similarly to how artificial intelligence has had to be scaled several times over until computers were powerful enough to transform the world. By investing, tracking, and creating better policy for this industry, governments would be able to harness the potential of quantum computing for good rather than lose out on what could be world altering technology. </p>
