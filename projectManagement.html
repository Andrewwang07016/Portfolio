	<p> Project management refers to the process of planning, organizing, and executing to deliver a successful project. This often includes a set time and budget. A software-tracking database refers to a database that tracks information about a particular software application. This could include the type of software, where it is from, who made it, versions, usage, dates, licenses, and other potentially crucial details. In the Project Management Handbook, we find that there are six project management steps. </p>

	<p> The first step is the initiation phase. “The goal of this phase is to examine the
feasibility of the project” (Baars, 2006, p. 1-2). In this phase, the project identifies the idea, explores, examines, and assesses feasibility. This means that this phase is responsible for outlining the project, from goals, potential partners, boundaries, and potential outcomes. In our implementation plan for the process of developing the database to track the institution's software. We will begin by identifying the users and any parties that may affect the process and delivery of the project. This would include the Information Technology (IT), academic, and administrative departments at the institution. In this phase, we also need to define the objective of the database, which is to track software usage. Additionally, it is important to answer the key questions posed by Baars: “Why this project? Is it feasible? Who are the possible partners? What should the results be? What are the boundaries of this project?” Answering these questions allows the concept to be effectively proposed to the institution's decision-makers.
 </p>


	<p> The second step is the definition phase. “In this phase, the requirements that are associated with a project result are specified as clearly as possible” (Baars, 2006, p. 1-3). This means that specified details regarding the delivery, function, design, and usage are laid out to all the members, which results in an agreed-upon process and outcome. Preventing misunderstanding, confusion, and costly mistakes that may later be discovered. In our case, we will collaborate with administrators to clearly outline the scope of the project. This would mean identifying what data needs to be tracked, such as the type of software, where it is from, who made it, versions, usage, dates, licenses, and other potentially crucial details. Additionally, in this phase, we will define roles and responsibilities and project this onto an organized document.</p>


	<p> The third step is the design phase. “Depending on the subject of the project, the products of the design phase can include dioramas, sketches, flow charts, site trees, HTML screen designs, prototypes, photo impressions and UML schemas” (Baars, 2006, p. 1-5). In this phase, a tangible blueprint of the project is created. These designs can be sketches, flowcharts, or diagrams, depending on the type of project. In our case, we will use diagrams to design the database and user interfaces. This will be mapped out in a data flow diagram, which will show how data flows through the different components that make up the entire system. “Once the template was reviewed, commented, and revised by all project members, it was shared as a plain document in a collaborative cloud” (Jackel, 2023, p.10). This ensures that everyone involved has access and communicates their thoughts on the project. </p>


	<p> The fourth step is the development phase. “Everything that will be needed to implement the project is arranged” (Baars, 2006, p. 1-6). This means that everything from supplies to materials, tools, instructions, and schedules will have to be made. In our case, we are going to have to write code; this would mean that we need to have a place to host the development of the database. “GitHub has version control, documentation, and licensing” (Castelli, 2021, p. 21). This means GitHub can be a place to set up documentation or licensing for our project. For our project, GitHub will be used since it is common and helps with collaboration and managing different versions of the project. </p>


	<p> The fifth step is the implementation phase. “This phase involves the construction of the actual project result” (Baars, 2006, p. 1-6). In this step, the work to build the project into a reality, or tangible form, takes place. If this requires programming, the programmers will be programming. If it requires construction, the construction will begin constructing, and so forth. During this phase, our team will have to focus on installing, configuring, training, and evaluating the database in the institution’s servers. To ensure a smoother process, manuals and video tutorials would be created, and our team would also address any issues that may arise when identified by users. </p>



	<p> The sixth and last step is the follow-up phase. “Examples of activities in the follow-up phase include writing handbooks, providing instruction and training for users, setting up a help desk, maintaining the result, evaluating the project itself, writing the project report, holding a party to celebrate the result that has been achieved, transferring to the directors and dismantling the project team” (Baars, 2006, p. 1-6). Often overlooked and neglected, this phase formally closes the project after the final tasks are completed. This decides the project’s full success and completion. For our team, proper evaluation is needed. Therefore, we would conduct a survey and take feedback. Additionally, a final post-compilation or project report would need to be documented for future reference. </p>

	<p> Developing a software tracking database for a college or university is tricky, but the project needs to have planning. In this case, a project management plan, with the steps of initiation, definition, design, development, implementation, and follow-up, is critical to the success of the team and the delivery of an effective and efficient database tracker. It not only provides a structure for successful delivery but streamlines the process and provides a future model for future data management projects. </p>
